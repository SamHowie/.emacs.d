* What is this?

This is my emacs config. It's written in a literate style with [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][org-babel]].

My init file is a huge org file sprinkled with elisp code blocks. These code blocks are evaluated by org-babel on startup.


* How do I view it?

GitHub can read =.org= files and render them nicely! But it is best read in emacs org-mode.

* Credits

I was shamelessly inspired by [[auwsmit/emacsconfig][https://github.com/auwsmit/emacsconfig]]. This is the repo that introduced me to the concept of org-babel and its possibilities.
